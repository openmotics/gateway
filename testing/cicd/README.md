# Integration Tests

The testing toolbox uses the following environment variables to connect to the
tester and dut gateways.  The tests also expects the event_observer and
syslog_receiver (debugging only) plugins to be installed on the tester gateway.

```
OPENMOTICS_TESTER_AUTH=username:password
OPENMOTICS_TESTER_HOST=gateway-tester.qa.openmotics.com
OPENMOTICS_DUT_AUTH=username:password
OPENMOTICS_DUT_HOST=gateway-testee-debian.qa.openmotics.com
```

- quick smoketest

```
pytest testing/cicd/tests --disable-warnings --hypothesis-profile once -m smoke
```

- full testrun

```
pytest testing/cicd/tests --disable-warnings --log-cli-level INFO --log-level DEBUG -m 'smoke or slow'
```

## Updating Firmware

The tests can also target specific firmware versions, in which case the gateway
will retrieve firmware from the cloud and flash it before running the tests.

```
OPENMOTICS_MASTER_FIRMWARE=3.143.93 pytest testing/cicd/tests --disable-warnings -m smoke
```

## Debugging

For debugging it can be useful to use the Toolbox interactively.

```
ipython -i testing/cicd/tests/conftest.py
In [1]: t = Toolbox()

In [2]: t.dut.login()
Out[2]: u'44b789c29aeb47eb8b93bff5f1c4113d'
```

## Target gateway deployment

The test system is also deployed slightly differently.

- syslog to the plugin running on the tester system

```
rsync rsyslog/99-openmotics-tester.conf target:/etc/rsyslog.d/
ssh target -- systemctl restart rsyslog
```

- run gateway services using systemd

```
rsync -a systemd/ target:/etc/systemd/system/
```

```
systemctl stop supervisor
systemctl disable supervisor

systemctl daemon-reload

systemctl enable openmotics
systemctl enable openmotics-led
systemctl enable openmotics-vpn
systemctl enable openmotics-watchdog

systemctl start openmotics
systemctl start openmotics-led
systemctl start openmotics-vpn
systemctl start openmotics-watchdog
```
